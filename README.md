# Quantum Key Distribution and Cryptography Example

This repository contains an example Python program that demonstrates the use of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Cryptography for secure communication. It combines principles from quantum computing, classical cryptography, and blockchain technology to ensure secure communication between two parties.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Qiskit (a quantum computing framework)
- cryptography (a cryptography library)
- hashlib (for SHA-256 hashing)
- secrets (for generating secure random values)
- An understanding of quantum computing and cryptography concepts

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-crypto-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd quantum-crypto-example
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install qiskit cryptography
   ```

4. Run the `quantum_crypto_example.py` script:

   ```bash
   python quantum_crypto_example.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Enter Your Name**: The program will prompt you to enter your name to identify the owner of the wallet.

2. **Wallet Security Key**: Replace `"YourWalletPrivateKey"` with your actual wallet's private key from a blockchain wallet. Make sure it's in bytes format.

3. **Enter Your Passphrase**: You'll be asked to enter a passphrase that will be used to derive an encryption key. This passphrase should be kept secret.

4. **Generate Keys**: The program will generate a quantum key using the BB84 protocol and exchange a partner key with a simulated partner. These keys will be printed to the console.

5. **SHA-256 Hash**: You can specify your data, and the program will calculate the SHA-256 hash of your data.

6. **Encryption and Decryption**: You can specify a secret message, which will be encrypted using the derived encryption key and then decrypted. The encrypted and decrypted messages will be printed.

7. **Quantum Repeater**: The program includes a basic quantum repeater mechanism. In this example, the HXXH operation is repeated three times.

8. **Results Saved**: The results, including the owner's name, quantum key, partner key, SHA-256 hash, encrypted message, and the derived passphrase key (Base64-encoded), will be saved to a JSON file named `results.json`.

## Important Notes

- This code is for educational purposes and may need further customization for production use.

- Ensure that you keep your passphrase and wallet private key secure.

- Understand the quantum principles and cryptography concepts used in this example for a deeper understanding.

- The quantum repeater mechanism in this code is simplified and not a complete quantum repeater protocol. In practice, quantum repeaters are more complex.
